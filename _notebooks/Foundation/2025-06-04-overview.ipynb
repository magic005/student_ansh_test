    "#  Open Coding Society Setup Redesign — Contributor Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Open Coding Society Setup Redesign Project**!  \n",
    "This project improves how students are onboarded into coding by simplifying the setup process across several tools and tracking their understanding with quizzes and a leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##  Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To redesign instructional pages on the Open Coding Society site so students can more easily:\n",
    "- Understand **what accounts to create** and why (including PII awareness)\n",
    "- Use **GitHub Pages** to deploy static sites in-browser via VSCode\n",
    "- Learn **Git/GitHub workflows** like `git pull`, `commit`, `forking`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site now also includes a login system, progress-tracking quizzes, and a working leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  What We Did\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Redesigned Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accounts Page**\n",
    "   - Teaches what accounts to create (GitHub, Replit, etc.)\n",
    "   - Introduces the concept of PII and safe digital practices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GitHub Pages Page**\n",
    "   - Teaches how GitHub Pages works\n",
    "   - Includes deployment of VSCode in-browser\n",
    "   - Guides students to publish their first static website\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GitHub Workflows Page**\n",
    "   - Covers essential Git commands like `pull`, `commit`, `clone`, `fork`\n",
    "   - Explains why these actions matter in collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Backend + Frontend Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Login System**: Users sign in; their token is saved in `localStorage`\n",
    "- **Token Authenticated Score Submission**: Only logged-in users can submit scores\n",
    "- **Quiz Completion Requirement**: All 3 quizzes (one per page) must be completed before score submission\n",
    "- **Relational Database**: Each score is tied to a specific user through a user ID (foreign key)\n",
    "- **Leaderboard**: Displays names and scores from the backend in order\n",
