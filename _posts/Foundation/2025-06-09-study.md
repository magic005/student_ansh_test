## Reflection

Teaching the team lessons helped me understand the topics better since I had to explain them clearly and break them down for others. The popcorn hacks and homework hacks were actually helpful because they gave us a chance to test ideas and learn from each other in real time. Overall, it was a good mix of learning and teaching that made the class more interactive.
