## Night at the Museum: A Space to Share and Learn

Night at the Museum (N@TM) has always been a valuable opportunity for me to showcase my work, engage with the community, and see the innovation happening all around me.

## Highlights from My Project Showcase

At these events, I presented three of my major projects from the year: **Student_2026**, **Club Hub**, and **SD IMOP**. Each of these represented a different aspect of my growth — from full-stack development to real-world machine learning deployment.

### Student_2026
- I explained how the template repository works, demonstrating how it provides a sleek, professional foundation for any student’s portfolio.
- Visitors appreciated how clean and customizable the theme was — especially teachers and students looking for a structured system to document their work.
- The technical explanation of how layouts, `_includes`, and front matter work sparked interest in static site generators and GitHub Pages.

### Club Hub
- I walked guests through the club recommendation algorithm, showing how shared interests are matched and dynamically ranked.
- Many attendees enjoyed seeing their own top matches change in real time as I adjusted the inputs.
- Several students commented that the system would be genuinely helpful during club rush or the start of the school year, which validated the practical value of our work.

### SD IMOP (San Diego Infrastructure Management Optimization Platform)
- This was the most impactful presentation of the night. I showed how we used real city datasets to predict infrastructure repair needs using XGBoost and Random Forest.
- Attendees (especially parents and community members) were impressed by how we combined public safety, machine learning, and civic utility into one solution.
- Several asked if it was really going to be adopted by the city — a question that made me reflect on how far this project has come and its potential next steps.

## Observing Other Projects

- I enjoyed exploring a wide variety of projects, from game engines to humanitarian alert systems like **Pyre**.
- Talking to the creators of tools like **Pawnsy** and **Travel Planner** gave me new perspectives on UI design, database handling, and backend logic.
- It was helpful to see how others presented their work — what resonated with the audience and where technical clarity mattered most.
- These insights will help me improve how I tell the story of my own projects in future showcases.

## Why Events Like This Matter

- Presenting in person helped me solidify my own understanding of the technologies and methodologies behind my projects.
- Explaining complex systems like IMOP to nontechnical audiences sharpened my ability to communicate effectively and clearly.
- The positive feedback and thoughtful questions made me feel validated, not just as a builder, but as someone creating work that could have real-world impact.

## Certifications

These certifications represent skills, achievements, and values I’ve demonstrated across my work this year.

- **Certified Infrastructure ML Engineer (CIME)**  
  Awarded for building and deploying predictive models for city infrastructure using real-world datasets, including Random Forest and XGBoost.

- **Certified Agile Product Owner (CAPO)**  
  Earned through consistent Scrum leadership, backlog grooming, and sprint planning in multi-developer environments.

- **Full-Stack Web Architect (FSWA)**  
  Granted for leading end-to-end web application development — from custom layout logic in Jekyll to dynamic JavaScript filtering interfaces.

- **GitHub Automation Specialist (GHAS)**  
  Given for leveraging GitHub workflows, Issues, and project boards as an integrated development environment.

- **Educational Platform Innovator (EPI)**  
  Recognized for designing Student_2026, a scalable portfolio system adopted across a classroom for long-term use.

## Tokens & NFTs (My Developer Identity)

These metaphorical tokens represent my traits, habits, and working style — forged through experience, not chance.

- **`Documenter`**  
  For meticulously logging progress, using GitHub Issues and commits as a living record of every decision.

- **`Methodist`**  
  For always engineering solutions with repeatable structure, from CI pipelines to reusable components.

- **`SprintCaptain`**  
  For leading from the front — managing standups, keeping momentum, and delivering under time pressure.

- **`Synthesizer`**  
  For connecting unrelated systems into unified architectures (e.g., combining civic data with predictive analytics).

- **`Debugger Supreme`**  
  For catching invisible bugs and solving deep architectural mismatches before anyone else notices.

- **`System Builder`**  
  For creating frameworks that empower others, not just finished apps.

## Final Thoughts

Night at the Museum was one of the most rewarding moments of the year.  
- It brought together creativity, curiosity, and collaboration in one space.  
- I’m proud of the systems I’ve built, but even more proud of how I’ve grown through them.  
- I’m excited to keep developing meaningful solutions — and to keep sharing them with others who are just as passionate.
