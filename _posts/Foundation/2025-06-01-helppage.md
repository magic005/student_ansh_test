## `poll.html`: Feedback Poll with Google Sheets Integration

Here is a more **technical version of the documentation** for the `poll.html` and `sidebar.html` components. This is suitable for developers or contributors looking to understand how the modules function and integrate into the larger lesson delivery system.

---



### **Overview**

The `poll.html` component collects user feedback using a thumbs-up/down interface, optional text input, and live data visualization via Google Sheets. It is styled with glassmorphism and animated UI elements, providing a modern feedback experience.

### **Integration Steps**

1. **Google Form Creation**

   * Create a Google Form with:

     * A multiple-choice field for "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down"
     * A short/paragraph text field for comments
   * Use "Form Response" > Google Sheets to link responses.
   * Publish the sheet to the web (File → Share → Publish to web).

2. **Configure the Poll**

   * Embed the published Google Sheet URL into the `iframe` in the analytics section of the poll.
   * Ensure field IDs in `submitFeedback()` JS match your form's input names.

3. **Live Dashboard**

   * The response iframe updates live with the published sheet.
   * Optionally, auto-refresh functionality can be customized via `refreshData()`.

### **Component Structure**

* `thumbsUp`, `thumbsDown` buttons:

  * Trigger `selectFeedback(direction)` and reveal feedback form.
* `feedbackForm`:

  * Contains a `textarea` and two buttons: Submit and Reset.
* `submitFeedback()`:

  * Sends feedback to the Google Form using a dynamically constructed POST request (not shown in current HTML but should be added for full automation).
* `dataToggle`:

  * Toggles visibility of the analytics iframe.
* `iframe#dataIframe`:

  * Displays the published Google Sheet with embedded analytics.

---


## `sidebar.html`: Interactive Learning Sidebar

### **Overview**

This sidebar provides in-lesson assistive tools. All operations are performed client-side with persistent local storage. Tools include a dictionary lookup (via [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev)), notes tied to highlights, text-to-speech (via VoiceRSS), and highlight annotations.

### **Core Functionalities**


#### 1. Dictionary Lookup


* Triggered by `#dictionary-button`
* Modal opens with:

  * Input field → `#dict-input`
  * Search button → `#search-dict`
* Uses `fetch` to call `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}`
* Response is parsed and rendered into `#dict-result`


#### 2. Notes with Highlight Context


* Notes are created in the `notes-panel` sidebar and linked to specific text highlights.
* Notes store:

  * `id`, `text`, `timestamp`, `highlightId`, `highlightedText`
* Stored in `localStorage` under `userNotes`
* Notes can be edited, deleted, and auto-scroll to associated highlight in `#lesson-content`.


#### 3. Text Highlighting


* Activates on `#highlight-button`
* Highlights wrap text nodes using `span.user-highlight`
* Each highlight includes:

  * `data-highlight-id`
  * Trash icon (`.highlight-trash-icon`) to delete highlight
  * Note icon (`.highlight-note-icon`) to attach/edit note
* Highlights persist via `localStorage` in `lessonHighlights`


#### 4. Text-to-Speech


* Triggered by `#tts-button`
* Reads selected text using VoiceRSS API (`https://api.voicerss.org`)
* Audio element is created dynamically if not present
* Requires VoiceRSS API key (currently hardcoded)

---


## Local Data Persistence


### Notes

```js
localStorage.setItem('userNotes', JSON.stringify(notesData));
```

### Highlights

```js
localStorage.setItem('lessonHighlights', lessonContent.innerHTML);
```

* Highlights restore on page load
* Script reattaches event listeners after restoration

---

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Copy `cover.html`** as template for new lessons
2. **Update frontmatter** with lesson-specific content:
   - `title`: Lesson name
   - `video_url`: YouTube video ID
   - `hack_prompt`: Coding challenge
   - `permalink`: Lesson URL
3. **Customize content** within `<div id="lesson-content">`
4. **Add features** using `include feature.html` tags
5. **Create supporting files** (flashcards.yml, game_questions.yml, etc.)
