## [Student_2026: Foundational Template for Student Portfolios](https://github.com/adik1025/student_2026)

**Student_2026** is a Jekyll-based template repository I created to streamline portfolio creation for students in our AP CSP course. It serves as a customizable, professional foundation for students to document their blog posts, reflections, and coding projects across the school year.

### My Role
- Sole developer and architect of the repository template.
- Provided comprehensive documentation so students could clone and configure their own sites with ease.
- Ensured clean UX and theme modularity so students could focus on their content, not debugging layouts.

### Technologies & Methodologies
- **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll with GitHub Pages integration.
- **Custom Front Matter Configs**: For post metadata, category sorting, and navigation.
- **Theme Components**: Modular `_includes`, `_layouts`, and SCSS architecture.
- **Version Control**: Git for collaborative debugging and enhancements.

### What I Learned
- Mastered static site structure and the importance of template generality vs. personalization.
- Strengthened skills in documentation and onboarding — this project had to be used by students of all skill levels.
- Learned how to build reusable infrastructure that prioritizes stability and customization equally.

## [Club Hub: Interest-Based Club Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/magic005/Club_Hub_Frontend)

**Club Hub** is a full-stack application that recommends student clubs based on matched interests. It solves a real problem in high schools: helping students discover communities they’ll actually enjoy and participate in.

### My Role
- **Scrum Master** and technical lead.
- Designed the matching algorithm and UI logic.
- Ensured sprint progress stayed on track and orchestrated stand-ups.

### Technologies & Methodologies
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS and JavaScript for responsive layout and card displays.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**:
  - Interests were tokenized and matched by similarity.
  - Rankings were assigned by how many interests aligned.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: JavaScript-based sorting and display logic to organize recommendations.
- **Agile Methodology**: Used sprints, issue tracking, and real-time collaboration.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Designed graceful UI behavior when no clubs matched (e.g., empty state messaging).

### What I Learned
- Deepened my understanding of user-centered design — especially in recommendation UX.
- Honed my ability to manage team deliverables and pivot during implementation.
- Learned how to combine frontend responsiveness with backend logic to create real-time interactivity.

## [SD IMOP (San Diego Infrastructure Management Optimization Platform)](https://github.com/adik1025/imop_frontend)

**SD IMOP** is a machine learning-driven infrastructure maintenance prediction platform built for potential adoption by the City of San Diego. It forecasts facility needs, optimizes repair timing, and improves public safety through proactive city planning.

### My Role
- Project Lead — initiated the idea, built the pipeline, managed timelines, and handled modeling.
- Designed the end-to-end data flow, from raw ingestion to ML model outputs.
- Created a fully operational dashboard UI for nontechnical stakeholders.

### Technologies & Methodologies
- **Data Integration**:
  - Unified multiple city datasets (street repair logs, pothole reports, weather, traffic, FCI ratings).
  - Ensured full place-ID coverage and filled in blanks without loss of information.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Initially tested Keras neural networks.
  - Final model stack: **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** for superior accuracy and interpretability.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Spatial and temporal features like seasonal weather trends, traffic volume by location, repair history counts.
- **Frontend Dashboard**:
  - Built using **vanilla JavaScript**.
  - Real-time filtering and facility-by-facility prediction views.
- **Agile Practices**: Weekly check-ins, live debugging sessions, and backlog grooming.
- **Government Readiness**:
  - Clean documentation and CSV pipelines for easy transfer to the city IT department.
  - Project is expected to be adopted by the San Diego government and lead to an internship.

### What I Learned
- Learned how to build enterprise-scale, production-ready ML pipelines.
- Gained real-world experience coordinating with city-level stakeholders and preparing government-facing deliverables.
- Refined my understanding of ensemble learning and model comparison.
- Sharpened my communication skills, both technical (code handoff) and non-technical (explaining findings to city staff).

## Skills and Qualities Demonstrated

- **Full-Stack Engineering**: Across all projects, from HTML/CSS/JS frontends to backend logic and ML pipelines.
- **Team Leadership**: As Scrum Master and Project Lead, I’ve coordinated deadlines, design decisions, and daily check-ins.
- **Agile Workflow Management**: Sprint planning, collaborative version control, iterative design.
- **Data Science & Modeling**: Real-world use of predictive analytics with explainability in mind.
- **Public Impact Engineering**: Building systems with real end-users and public institutions in mind.
