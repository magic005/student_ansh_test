## [Student_2026: Foundational Template for Student Portfolios](https://github.com/adik1025/student_2026)

**Student_2026** is a Jekyll-based GitHub repository I developed as a professional, fully customizable template for student portfolios in our AP CSP course. It allows peers to showcase their blogs and projects without needing to set up anything from scratch.

### My Role
- Sole developer and systems designer of the repository structure and theme.
- Authored documentation and usage guides for seamless onboarding.
- Maintained version control and handled updates based on user feedback.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Jekyll**: Static site generation.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project-wide issue tracking.
- **Liquid / HTML / SCSS**: Theming and layout customization.
- **GitHub Pages**: Zero-setup site hosting.
- **Markdown**: Content formatting and post structure.
- **VS Code**: Primary development environment.

### What I Learned
- Deep understanding of GitHub Pages and Jekyll pipelines.
- Experience designing reusable infrastructure at scale.
- Skill in writing developer-first documentation and helping others deploy with confidence.

## [Club Hub: Interest-Based Club Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/magic005/Club_Hub_Frontend)

**Club Hub** is a smart club recommendation tool for high school students. It takes user interests, compares them to club profiles, and ranks the most relevant ones using a live-updating interface.

### My Role
- Scrum Master and algorithm developer.
- Oversaw sprint planning and peer coordination.
- Designed frontend logic and assisted with API design.

### Tools & Technologies
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS**: Frontend layout and dynamic sorting.
- **Git & GitHub Projects**: Issue tracking, branching strategy, and pull request management.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints and validating backend responses.
- **Agile Development**: Stand-ups, velocity tracking, sprint retrospectives.
- **Figma**: UI mockups and early design discussions.

### What I Learned
- How to handle asynchronous updates and sorting in pure JS.
- Best practices for testing APIs and visualizing responses with Postman.
- Practical project management under Agile constraints and short timelines.

## [SD IMOP (San Diego Infrastructure Management Optimization Platform)](https://github.com/adik1025/imop_frontend)

**SD IMOP** is a machine learning platform designed to forecast infrastructure maintenance using city data. It unifies disparate data sources, performs intelligent forecasting, and outputs actionable insights via a dashboard.

### My Role
- Project Lead — handled all modeling, data prep, and frontend UI development.
- Created reproducible data pipelines and facility-level predictions.
- Communicated with potential city stakeholders for real-world deployment.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Data cleaning, transformation, and prep.
- **XGBoost / Random Forest (via scikit-learn)**: Predictive modeling and tuning.
- **Flask**: RESTful backend for model integration and predictions.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Interactive frontend dashboard.
- **CSV + JSON Pipelines**: For handling real-world datasets and formatted exports.
- **Postman**: Endpoint testing during Flask backend development.
- **Git**: Branching, commits, merges across frontend/backend components.
- **Google Sheets + FCI APIs**: Raw data ingestion and normalization.

### What I Learned
- End-to-end architecture design for civic ML applications.
- Experience translating raw city datasets into feature-rich ML-ready inputs.
- Mastery of Flask backend deployment and JavaScript-based frontend coordination.

These projects were built not only with **methods and vision**, but with a robust **technical stack** that reflects real-world development, testing, and deployment practices. Each tool and platform was chosen intentionally — not just to build something functional, but to ensure maintainability, scalability, and user empowerment.
